        "\n",
        "Possible data to collect would be:\n",
        " * age of student - Age could influence desired loan options, ability to repay, terms requested, and probability that degree will be completed.\n",
        " * gpa - Grade point average may influence probability of degree completion, employability, etc. which in turn may impact what options are available to the student.\n",
        " * education level completed - Education level completed would show whether student has completed higher education and is looking to extend the degree. For example, a student have completed a bachelor's but is now working towards a master's degree. Also, high school versus GED might be a distinguishing factor in credit worthiness.\n",
        " * field of study - the chosen field may have a higher or lower level of employment post-education which would impact risk of defaulting thus impacting the loan options.\n",
        " * degree/certificate applying for - The degree could impact repayment. For example, a doctor or lawyer may have residency or supervisory period after graduation and/or may also require exams to be passed before able to earn expected pay scale. Whereas, some degrees may be immediately employable. This could impact desired terms. Some loan options are only available to undergraduates whereas other loan options are available to graduates. Some degrees are for non-traditional students and the repayment terms could be immediate while the degree is still in progress. \n",
        " * college/university - This would impact the amount needed. A public university versus a private university effects financing needs.\n",
        " * current location - This would impact in state and out of state tuition along with financing needs.\n",
        " * employment status of student - Unemployed, part time employment, or full time employment will impact repayment schedules as well as amounts to finance. Some loans may be directed to tuition only while others cover living expenses.\n",
        " * employment status of parents - Parents of traditional students are often considered in loan options for students.\n",
        " * loan amount requested - Some loan options may have minimum or maximum requirements or lifetime limitations that are impacted.\n",
        " * loan purpose - Some loan options may be limited to specific purpose for example tuition only, living expenses, etc.\n",
        " * repayment terms - Some loan options may be impacted by repayment terms requested. For example, if student is willing to begin repayment immediately, certain interest rates may be available or special terms.\n",
        " * cosigners - Loan options may be increased if student has a cosigner willing to sign. For example, a student requesting $200,000 in loan amount but has a cosigner may have more options than a student with no cosigners.\n",

        "**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types of filtering that would be applicable to the data listed in #1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Collaborative filtering would suggest items to students based on the similarity to other users. So the data collected would compare students to other students and what loan options were selected. For example, traditional students between the ages of 17-23 going for a bachelor's degree, would be given loan options that others in that demographic have recommended/selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "It would also be possible to create a context-based filtering recommendation system. For example, if a student was already employed but going for a graduate degree or certificate, then only select loan options would be available.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data collected is flexible enough to develop either type of filtering process. Futhermore, hybrid modeling can often outperform modeling that is only focused on one type of system because it is more comprehensive in nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**\n",
        "\n",
        "One real world challenge would be race discrimination in the recommendation process. #1 excluded any requests for race/ethnicity in the data collected or used in the recommendation system. It would be important to not collect this data and have any bias introduced to the model related to race/ethnicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "A second real world challenge would be sex or sexual orientation discrimination in the recommendation process. #1 excluded any requests for information related to sex or sexual orientation. It would be important to not collect this data and have any bias introduced to the model related to sex/sexual orientation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommendation system should be free of legally protected fields/information. In addition to the two mentioned, no information should be collected about religious preferences/affiliations or disabilities. It is important to follow both federal and state laws in regards to education and finances. Since the recommendation system covers both education and finance sectors, it would be important to have full knowledge of laws, requirements, and documentation procedures in collecting the data and developing the models. There may be applicable reporting requirements under both or only one sector that would necessitate additional steps in the modeling process. If after reviewing the applicable laws, it may be necessary to remove certain data collected from the source, for example age. While age is currently listed as a feature to collect in the data, legal requirements may require the elimination of certain fields. It would be important to insure that the information collected met all requirements before modeling and recommending.\n",
        "\n",
        "There may also be additional requirements for GDPR compliance. These requirements will also need to be implemented. There may also be some requirements around deletion of data if requested by the student and/or parents. The data collection and storage process will need to be reviewed to insure compliance with GDPR. If data is used in modeling, it may be necessary to remove requested data and then retrain models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data recommended in #1 excluded PII (Personally Identifiable Information). It would be worth investigating whether PII can be collected to use in the recommendation system. Some examples of PII would include student's annual income, credit score, and debt obligations and parents' annual income, credit score, and debt obligations. All of these data points could have valuable impact on the modeling results and the recommendation system for loan options. However, the legal requirements around handling of PII may be cost prohibitive, so it may be better to exclude these features. \n"
