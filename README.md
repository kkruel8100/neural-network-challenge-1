### Welcome to Kim's Neural Network Challenge #1

where we use Standard Scaler, TensorFlow, and Sklearn for deep learning with neural networks.

#### Overview

Showcasing Python, Pandas, Sklearn, and Tensor Flow, the challenge gathers information about student loan risks. It separates the data in train and test and scales the data. It creates a Sequential model with two hidden layers and one output layer and compiles the data using binary_crossentropy loss function, adam optimizer, and the accuracy evaluation metric. The model is then evaluated, saved as keras file, and reloaded. The reloaded model is used to make predictions and a classification report is printed.
